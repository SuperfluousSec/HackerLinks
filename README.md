Collection of Red Team, Blue Team, Purple Team, Hunt Team, Defense, and other hacker realted stuff.

Throughout the year, seeing various sweet work, cool bypasses, fun hunt tips and so forth, I started to at least keep a list so I can find crap again. This was the best way I could think of and also be able to share it with everyone.  Should be easy, to find as I break them up by year.  I'll try to be better about updating these more often, plus it'll save me a LOT of time.
